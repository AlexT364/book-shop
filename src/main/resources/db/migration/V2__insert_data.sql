(1,'War and Peace','War and Peace is a well-known 19th-century Russian novel, written and published by author Leo Tolstoy in 1867. It shows the epic story of Russian society as it was during the 1812 French invasion of Russia. The story follows three famous characters in world literature: Natasha Rostov, Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, and Pierre Bezukhov. Tolstoy follows each character, all of whom come from different backgrounds; from peasants to nobility, from civilians to soldiers. The reader watches them struggle with issues distinct to the 1800s and watches them grow from the start to finish in all ways: personally, emotionally, historically, and culturally.\nThough this was Tolstoy\'s first great war novel, he went in to publish other famous works such as Anna Karenina (1877) and The Death of Ivan Ilyich (1886). Tolstoy enjoyed writing novels about the mundane aspects of everyday life, and the relationships between humans. War and Peace won critical acclamation due to its vivid exploration of Russian philosophy and history. ','1400079985',14.95,10,0,'2025-06-19 18:53:18'),
(2,'Cherry Orchard','Enter the bittersweet world of \"The Cherry Orchard,\" Anton Chekhov\'s last and greatest play, a masterpiece that captures the tumultuous change sweeping through early 20th-century Russia with humor, compassion, and psychological depth.\nAs the aristocratic Ranevskaya returns to her family estate after years in Paris, she finds herself on the brink of financial ruin. The beloved cherry orchard, a symbol of her youth and happier times, is soon to be auctioned to pay the family debts. The proposal to save the estate by cutting down the orchard and building holiday cottages meets resistance, weaving a complex tapestry of social change, denial, and progress.\nChekhov masterfully blends tragedy and comedy, creating a richly drawn ensemble of characters caught between the past and the future, dreams and reality. \"The Cherry Orchard\" is not only a poignant commentary on the fading aristocracy and the rise of a new social order in Russia but also a universal story of change, loss, and renewal.','1350501727',7.41,5,0,'2025-06-19 18:53:18'),

One spring afternoon, the Devil, trailing fire and chaos in his wake, weaves himself out of the shadows and into Moscow. Mikhail Bulgakov’s fantastical, funny, and devastating satire of Soviet life combines two distinct yet interwoven parts, one set in contemporary Moscow, the other in ancient Jerusalem, each brimming with historical, imaginary, frightful, and wonderful characters. Written during the darkest days of Stalin’s reign, and finally published in 1966 and 1967, The Master and Margarita became a literary phenomenon, signaling artistic and spiritual freedom for Russians everywhere.','0143108271',29.44,8,0,'2025-06-19 18:53:18'),
(4,'Anna Karenina','At its simplest, Anna Karenina is a love story. It is a portrait of a beautiful and intelligent woman whose passionate love for a handsome officer sweeps aside all other ties - to her marriage and to the network of relationships and moral values that bind the society around her. The love affair of Anna and Vronsky is played out alongside the developing romance of Kitty and Levin, and in the character of Levin, closely based on Tolstoy himself, the search for happiness takes on a deeper philosophical significance.\nOne of the greatest novels ever written, Anna Karenina combines penetrating psychological insight with an encyclopedic depiction of Russian life in the 1870s. The novel takes us from high society St Petersburg to the threshing fields on Levin\'s estate, with unforgettable scenes at a Moscow ballroom, the skating rink, a race course, a railway station. It creates an intricate labyrinth of connections that is profoundly satisfying, and deeply moving.','0198800533',30.12,0,0,'2025-06-19 18:53:18'),
(5,'Government Inspector','The Government Inspector and Other Works. Gogol\'s works constitute one of Russian literature\'s supreme achievements, yet the nature of their brilliant originality, comic genius, and complex workings is difficult to summarize precisely. The Government Inspector, a perennial favourite on stage and screen, is considered a national institution in Russia, and Gogol\'s stories present us with one of the most marvellous worlds a writer has ever created. His quirky characters - the lowly official who imagines himself to be the King of Spain, the man committed to chase his nose around St. Petersburg, a whole village paralyzed at the prospect of being visited by an authority from the capital - are immortal. Although Gogol\'s fiction was commandeered by Russia\'s progressive critics as the work of an important social commentator, he was in many ways an arch-conservative, and there is a madcap strain in it that makes him a precursor of Kafka and absurdist drama.','184022729X',16.22,1,0,'2025-06-19 18:53:18'),
(6,'Crime and Punishment','Crime and Punishment is a novel by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky. It was first published in the literary journal The Russian Messenger in twelve monthly installments during 1866. It was later published in a single volume. It is the second of Dostoevsky\'s full-length novels following his return from ten years of exile in Siberia. Crime and Punishment is considered the first great novel of his mature period of writing and is often cited as one of the greatest works of world literature.\nCrime and Punishment follows the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who plans to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker, an old woman who stores money and valuable objects in her flat. He theorises that with the money he could liberate himself from poverty and go on to perform great deeds, and seeks to convince himself that certain crimes are justifiable if they are committed in order to remove obstacles to the higher goals of \"extraordinary\" men. Once the deed is done, however, he finds himself wracked with confusion, paranoia, and disgust. His theoretical justifications lose all their power as he struggles with guilt and horror and is confronted with both internal and external consequences of his deed.','0679734503',21.68,0,0,'2025-06-19 18:53:18'),

Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking.

(15,'Heart of a Dog','I first read Mikhail Bulgakov\'s The Master and Margarita on a balcony of the Hotel Metropole in Saigon on three summer evenings in 1971. The tropical air was heavy and full of the smells of cordite and motorcycle exhaust and rotting fish and wood-fire stoves, and the horizon flared ambiguously, perhaps from heat lightning, perhaps from bombs. Later each night, as was my custom, I would wander out into the steamy back alleys of the city, where no one ever seemed to sleep, and crouch in doorways with the people and listen to the stories of their culture and their ancestors and their ongoing lives. Bulgakov taught me to hear something in those stories that I had not yet clearly heard. One could call it, in terms that would soon thereafter gain wide currency, \"magical realism\". The deadpan mix of the fantastic and the realistic was at the heart of the Vietnamese mythos. It is at the heart of the present zeitgeist. And it was not invented by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, as wonderful as his One Hundred Years of Solitude is. Garcia Marquez\'s landmark work of magical realism was predated by nearly three decades by Bulgakov\'s brilliant masterpiece of a novel. That summer in Saigon a vodka-swilling, talking black cat, a coven of beautiful naked witches, Pontius Pilate, and a whole cast of benighted writers of Stalinist Moscow and Satan himself all took up permanent residence in my creative unconscious. Their presence, perhaps more than anything else from the realm of literature, has helped shape the work I am most proud of. I\'m often asked for a list of favorite authors. Here is my advice. Read Bulgakov. Look around you at the new century. He will show you things you need to see.','0802150594',7.24,48,0,'2025-06-19 18:53:18'),

But his life is thrown into turmoil when he chances on a photograph of the beautiful Nastasya Filippovna. Utterly infatuated, he soon finds himself caught up in a love triangle and drawn into a web of blackmail, betrayal, and finally, murder. In Prince Myshkin, Dostoyevsky portrays the purity of “a truly beautiful soul” and explores the perils that innocence and goodness face in a corrupt world.\r\n \r\nDavid McDuff\'s translation brilliantly captures the novel\'s idiosyncratic and dream-like language and the nervous, elliptic flow of the narrative.

He is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential authors of all time.\r\n\r\nBorn to an aristocratic family, Tolstoy achieved acclaim in his twenties with his semi-autobiographical trilogy, Childhood, Boyhood and Youth (1852–1856), and with Sevastopol Sketches (1855), based on his experiences in the Crimean War. His War and Peace (1869), Anna Karenina (1878), and Resurrection (1899), which is based on his youthful sins, are often cited as pinnacles of realist fiction and three of the greatest novels ever written. His oeuvre includes short stories such as \"Alyosha the Pot\" (1911) and \"After the Ball\" (1911) and novellas such as Family Happiness (1859), The Death of Ivan Ilyich (1886), The Kreutzer Sonata (1889), The Devil (1911), and Hadji Murat (1912). He also wrote plays and essays concerning philosophical, moral and religious themes.\r\n\r\nTolstoy received praise from countless authors and critics, both during his lifetime and after. Virginia Woolf called Tolstoy \"the greatest of all novelists\", and Gary Saul Morson referred to War and Peace as the greatest of all novels. He received nominations for the Nobel Prize in Literature every year from 1902 to 1906 and for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1901, 1902, and 1909.

(2,'Anton Pavlovich Chekhov (Russian: Антон Павлович Чехов, 29 January 1860 – 15 July 1904) was a Russian playwright and short-story writer, widely considered to be one of the greatest writers of all time. His career as a playwright produced four classics, and his best short stories are held in high esteem by writers and critics. Along with Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg, Chekhov is often referred to as one of the three seminal figures in the birth of early modernism in the theatre. Chekhov was a physician by profession. \"Medicine is my lawful wife,\" he once said, \"and literature is my mistress.\"\r\n\r\nChekhov renounced the theatre after the reception of The Seagull in 1896, but the play was revived to acclaim in 1898 by Konstantin Stanislavski\'s Moscow Art Theatre, which subsequently also produced Chekhov\'s Uncle Vanya and premiered his last two plays, Three Sisters and The Cherry Orchard. These four works present a challenge to the acting ensemble as well as to audiences, because in place of conventional action Chekhov offers a \"theatre of mood\" and a \"submerged life in the text.\" The plays that Chekhov wrote were not complex, but easy to follow, and created a somewhat haunting atmosphere for the audience.','Anton','Chekhov'),
(3,'Mikhail Afanasyevich Bulgakov ( Russian: Михаил Афанасьевич Булгаков, 15 May  1891 – 10 March 1940) was a Soviet novelist and playwright of Russian origin. His novel The Master and Margarita, published posthumously, has been called one of the masterpieces of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nHe also wrote the novel The White Guard and the plays Ivan Vasilievich, Flight (also called The Run), and The Days of the Turbins. He wrote mostly about the horrors of the Russian Civil War and about the fate of Russian intellectuals and officers of the Tsarist Army caught up in revolution and Civil War.\r\n\r\nSome of his works (Flight, all his works between the years 1922 and 1926, and others) were banned by the Soviet government, and personally by Joseph Stalin, after it was decided by them that they \"glorified emigration and White generals\". On the other hand, Stalin loved The Days of the Turbins (also called The Turbin Brothers) very much and reportedly saw it at least 15 times.','Mikhail','Bulgakov'),
(4,'Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol (1 April 1809 – 4 March 1852) was a Russian novelist, short story writer, and playwright of Ukrainian origin.\r\n\r\nGogol used the grotesque in his writings, for example, in his works \"The Nose\", \"Viy\", \"The Overcoat\", and \"Nevsky Prospekt\". These stories, and others such as \"Diary of a Madman\", have also been noted for their proto-surrealist qualities. According to Viktor Shklovsky, Gogol used the technique of defamiliarization when a writer presents common things in an unfamiliar or strange way so that the reader can gain new perspectives and see the world differently. His early works, such as Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka, were influenced by his Ukrainian upbringing, Ukrainian culture and folklore. His later writing satirised political corruption in contemporary Russia (The Government Inspector, Dead Souls), although Gogol also enjoyed the patronage of Tsar Nicholas I who liked his work. The novel Taras Bulba (1835), the play Marriage (1842), and the short stories \"The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich\", \"The Portrait\", and \"The Carriage\" are also among his best-known works.\r\n\r\nMany writers and critics have recognized Gogol\'s deep influence on Russian, Ukrainian and world literature. Gogol\'s influence was acknowledged by Fyodor Dostoevsky, Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin, Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Franz Kafka, Mikhail Bulgakov, Vladimir Nabokov, Flannery O\'Connor and others. Eugène-Melchior de Vogüé said: \"We all came out from under Gogol\'s Overcoat.\"','Nikolai','Gogol'),
(5,'Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky (11 November 1821 – 9 February 1881) was a Russian novelist, short story writer, essayist and journalist. Numerous literary critics regard him as one of the greatest novelists in all of world literature, as many of his works are considered highly influential masterpieces. Dostoevsky\'s literary works explore the human condition in the troubled political, social, and spiritual atmospheres of 19th-century Russia, and engage with a variety of philosophical and religious themes. His most acclaimed novels include Crime and Punishment (1866), The Idiot (1869), Demons (1872), The Adolescent (1875), and The Brothers Karamazov (1880). His 1864 novella Notes from Underground is considered to be one of the first works of existentialist literature.\r\n\r\nDostoevsky\'s body of work consists of thirteen novels, three novellas, seventeen short stories, and numerous other works. His writings were widely read both within and beyond his native Russia and influenced an equally great number of later writers including Russians such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Anton Chekhov, philosophers Friedrich Nietzsche, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre, and the emergence of Existentialism and Freudianism. His books have been translated into more than 170 languages, and served as the inspiration for many films.','Fyodor','Dostoyevsky'),

(7,'Franklin Patrick Herbert Jr. (October 8, 1920 – February 11, 1986) was an American science-fiction author, best known for his 1965 novel Dune and its five sequels. He also wrote short stories and worked as a newspaper journalist, photographer, book reviewer, ecological consultant, and lecturer.\r\n\r\nDune is the best-selling science fiction novel of all time, and the series is a classic of the science-fiction genre. The Dune saga, set in the distant future and taking place over millennia, explores complex themes, such as the long-term survival of the human species, human evolution, planetary science and ecology, and the intersection of religion, politics, economics, sex, and power in a future where humanity has long since developed interstellar travel and colonized many thousands of worlds.\r\n\r\nThe series has been adapted numerous times, including the feature film David Lynch\'s Dune (1984), the miniseries Frank Herbert\'s Dune (2000) and Children of Dune (2003), and a motion picture trilogy currently in production, with Denis Villeneuve\'s Dune (2021) and Dune: Part Two (2024) having been released.','Frank','Herbert'),

(9,'John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (3 January 1892 – 2 September 1973) was an English writer and philologist. He was the author of the high fantasy works The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.\r\n\r\nFrom 1925 to 1945, Tolkien was the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and a Fellow of Pembroke College, both at the University of Oxford. He then moved within the same university to become the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College, and held these positions from 1945 until his retirement in 1959. Tolkien was a close friend of C. S. Lewis, a co-member of the informal literary discussion group The Inklings. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972.\r\n\r\nWhile many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the tremendous success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings ignited a profound interest in the fantasy genre and ultimately precipitated an avalanche of new fantasy books and authors. As a result, he has been popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature and is widely regarded as one of the most influential authors of all time.','J.R.R.','Tolkien'),

(15,'Mark Twain is the pseudonym of Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835 - 1910). He was born and brought up in the American state of Missouri and, because of his father\'s death, he left school to earn his living when he was only twelve. He was a great adventurer and travelled round America as a printer; prospected for gold and set off for South America to earn his fortune. He returned to become a steam-boat pilot on the Mississippi River, close to where he had grown up. The Civil War put an end to steam-boating and Clemens briefly joined the Confederate army - although the rest of his family were Unionists! He had already tried his hand at newspaper reporting and now became a successful journalist. He started to use the alias Mark Twain during the Civil War and it was under this pen name that he became a famous travel writer. He took the name from his steam-boat days - it was the river pilots\' cry to let their men know that the water was two fathoms deep.\r\n\r\nMark Twain was always nostalgic about his childhood and in 1876 The Adventures of Tom Sawyer was published, based on his own experiences. The book was soon recognised as a work of genius and eight years later the sequel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, was published. The great writer Ernest Hemingway claimed that \'All modern literature stems from this one book.\'\r\n\r\nMark Twain was soon famous all over the world. He made a fortune from writing and lost it on a typesetter he invented. He then made another fortune and lost it on a bad investment. He was an impulsive, hot-tempered man but was also quite sentimental and superstitious. He was born when Halley\'s Comet was passing the Earth and always believed he would die when it returned - this is exactly what happened.','Mark','Twain'),
(16,'Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was born in Edinburgh in 1859 and died in 1930. Within those years was crowded a variety of activity and creative work that made him an international figure and inspired the French to give him the epithet \'the good giant\'. He was the nephew of \'Dickie Doyle\' the artist, and was educated at Stonyhurst, and later studied medicine at Edinburgh University, where the methods of diagnosis of one of the professors provided the idea for the methods of deduction used by Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\nHe set up as a doctor at Southsea and it was while waiting for patients that he began to write. His growing success as an author enabled him to give up his practice and turn his attention to other subjects. He was a passionate advocate of many causes, ranging from divorce law reform and the Channel Tunnel to the issuing of inflatable life-jackets to sailors. He also campaigned to prove the innocence of individuals, and his work on the Edjalji case was instrumental in the introduction of the Court of Criminal Appeal. He was a volunteer physician in the Boer War and later in life became a convert to spiritualism.\r\n\r\nHis greatest achievement was, of course, his creation of Sherlock Holmes, who soon attained international status and constantly distracted him from his other work; at one time Conan Doyle killed him but was obliged by public protest to restore him to life. And in his creation of Dr Watson, Holmes\'s companion in adventure and chronicler, Conan Doyle produced not only a perfect foil for Holmes but also one of the most famous narrators in fiction.
